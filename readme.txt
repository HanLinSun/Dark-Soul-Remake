The game document is too big to upload on github.
So I update them on github-release.
This is an unfinished project, but if I have time I will keep working on it.
And I believe this is certainly shows my game development technique to some extent.
This was a Unity project, so after rezip, please make sure to use Unity Engine(2020.4.10 or above) to open it.
